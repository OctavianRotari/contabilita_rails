#Contabilita Rails (Accounting)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OctavianRotari/contabilita_rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/OctavianRotari/contabilita_rails)

This is a web-app developed with Rails. Itâ€™s purpose is to help small-scale
transport companies with their accounting. All expenses are registered (invoices, tickets etc)
as well as vehicles and categories, then accountability calculations are performed
and the owners can see an overview of expenditures and profits.

##Approach


The development began with a recap of my knowledge on accounting, in order to pinpoint the
critical points in the running of a company to collect and calcucate costs. Next the
user-friendly interface and objects/class were sketched in order to make the app function.
Next through an exhaustive trial and error process with different functions and codes, the web-app was developed.

##Conclusions


This app development broadened my skill set substantially and taught me the importance of
some particular aspects. First and foremost, the importance of testing. As the development
progresses and grows in size and complexity, so too does the emphasis on testing, otherwise a bug
could get embedded in the labyrinth of complex code, undetected without systematic verification. Furthermore,
the importance of preliminary sketching of initial ideas on app appearance, features and functions. This forms a
framework, leading to more efficient and productive development. Finally, the continued bidirectional communication
with the intended    users is absolutely crucial, this ultimately allows for a website and app which is of
optimum use and ease for the  unique client.
